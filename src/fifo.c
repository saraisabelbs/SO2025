/**
 * @brief First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm.
 *
 * This function implements the FIFO scheduling algorithm. If the CPU is not idle it
 * checks if the application is ready and frees the CPU.
 * If the CPU is idle, it selects the next task to run based on the order they were added
 * to the ready queue. The task that has been in the queue the longest is selected to run next.
 *
 * @param current_time_ms The current time in milliseconds.
 * @param rq Pointer to the ready queue containing tasks that are ready to run.
 * @param cpu_task Double pointer to the currently running task. This will be updated
 *                 to point to the next task to run.
